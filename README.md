# Taxi-Simulation
Simulation designed to demonstrate a multi-threaded system where taxis and passengers threads run concurrently. It applies thread synchronization to protect shared resources, enables inter-thread communication for coordination, and uses deadlock prevention techniques to ensure safe and efficient execution.
